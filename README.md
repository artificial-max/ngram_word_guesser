# ngram_word_guesser
A word guessing game using ngrams.  
The player enteres a sentence with one word left out (denoted with '_'), the computer tries to guess it.  
## Example:  
  **Player input:** It's raining _ and dogs    
  **Response:** My guess is *cats*  

## Requirements:
- Python3. 
- The *brown* and the *webtext* corpus from nltk. 
  If you do not have those installed, you will be asked whether you want to install them when starting the game.   
  If you answer with 'y', nltk.download() will be called for you, where you can manually select *brown* and *webtext* under corpora.  

## To Play: 
Start word_guesser.py in the src directory.
