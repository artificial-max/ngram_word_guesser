# ngram_word_guesser
A word guessing game using ngrams.

Requirements: 
- Python3. 
- Make sure you have the brown and the webtext corpus installed. 
  If you do not have those installed, you will be asked whether you want to install them. 
  If you answer with 'y', nltk.download() will be called for you, where you can manually select brown and webtext under corpora.

To play: Start word_guesser.py in the src directory.
