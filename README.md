# ngram_word_guesser
A word guessing game using ngrams.  
The player enteres a sentence with one word left out, the computer tries to guess it.  
Example:  
  Player input: It's raining _ and dogs    
  Response: My guess is *cats*  

Requirements: 
- Python3. 
- Make sure you have the brown and the webtext corpus installed. 
  If you do not have those installed, you will be asked whether you want to install them.   
  If you answer with 'y', nltk.download() will be called for you, where you can manually select brown and webtext under corpora.  

To play: Start word_guesser.py in the src directory.
