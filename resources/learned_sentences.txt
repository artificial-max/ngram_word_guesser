a dozen a dime
it is raining cats and dogs
I want a cheese sandwich
like day and night
he kicked the bucket
to kick the bucket
from dusk until dawn
from dusk til dawn
he was seven feet tall
two flies with one stone
many trees make a forest
he lost his way
vegetables are healthy
cats are cute
my cat is cute
dogs are cool
my dog is cool
what is my life
hello there
get well soon
bless you
I will never be defeated
it is raining men
like father like son
Luke I am your father
Han Solo shot first
He spilled the beans
24 7
artificial intelligence
Snow White and the seven dwarfs
The wizard of Oz
Happy Birthday
happy birthday
it is raining cats and dogs
do you even lift bro
I ate a cake
I lost the game
the life of Brian
I want to get away
this was the best best of my life
fish and fish and chips
milk and cereal
how much wood would a woodchuck chuck
it was not easy it was hard
killing is evil
who you gonna call
I took off my shoes
please be quiet
Tom and Jerry
the meaning of life
I drove my car to work
I rode my bike to work
I like to pet my pet
my hair is fabulous
hello there
I am singing in the rain
the meaning of life
the center of the universe
I do not like you
I don't envy you
I need to get some work done .
what am I doing with my life
what am I doing with my life ?
pirates drink grog
I like to ski in winter
he kicked the bucket
I graduated from college
it's raining cats and dogs
The life of Brian
what has been seen cannot be unseen
Houston, we have a problem !
he went to bed tired
I hate mondays
the water spilled out of the bottle
he spilled the beans
no one expects the Spanish Inquisition
jokes are funny
sleep is overrated
resistance is futile
to smoke cigarettes
we are doomed
she wished upon a star
she went to bed because she was tired
she was wearing a dress
I shot the sherrif
the car ran out of gas
men and women are equal
I want to ride my bicycle
