a dozen a dime
it is raining cats and dogs
I want a cheese sandwich
like day and night
he kicked the bucket
to kick the bucket
from dusk until dawn
from dusk til dawn
he was seven feet tall
two flies with one stone
many trees make a forest
he lost his way
vegetables are healthy
cats are cute
my cat is cute
dogs are cool
my dog is cool
what is my life
hello there
get well soon
bless you
I will never be defeated
it is raining men
like father like son
Luke I am your father
Han Solo shot first
He spilled the beans
24 7
artificial intelligence
Snow White and the seven dwarfs
The wizard of Oz
Happy Birthday
happy birthday
it is raining cats and dogs
